# Basmati Rice Grain Segmentation and Classification

This project focuses on segmenting and classifying Basmati rice grains using a fine-tuned YOLOv8 model. The application distinguishes between Basmati and non-Basmati rice grains based on their morphological features. The project also includes a Flask web application deployed on PythonAnywhere for easy access and use.

## Project Overview

### Key Features
- **Segmentation & Classification**: Utilizes a fine-tuned YOLOv8 model to segment individual rice grains and classify them as either Basmati or non-Basmati based on their morphological properties.
- **Web Application**: Built using Flask to provide a user-friendly interface for uploading and classifying rice grain images.
